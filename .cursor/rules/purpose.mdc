I want to create a website that demo my startup ideas. 

The website techstack is :

useing node.js 22


the website similar to : https://www.finch3d.com/ 
I can disply gif and images . 
The Home page has Title on the Left: ArchiCopilot. 
and right has clicable tag as "Contact" "Request Demo"

Vision and Objectives
The vision of ArchiCopilot is to transform the architectural design process by harnessing AI to address persistent inefficiencies and elevate the quality of outcomes. Traditional architectural workflows often rely on manual iterations, compliance reviews, and documentation, which consume significant time and resources, detracting from creative exploration and strategic decision-making. ArchiCopilot aims to mitigate these challenges by delivering a sophisticated intelligent assistant that enhances productivity by up to 50% while ensuring precision and regulatory adherence. Its core objectives include:
1.	Real-Time Design Support: Provide architects with context-aware recommendations during modeling or drafting, suggesting continuations based on spatial layouts, structural requirements, and project goals—akin to how coding tools suggest syntax or functions.
2.	Automated Compliance Verification: Enable real-time checking of designs against relevant building codes and standards, reducing errors and ensuring regulatory alignment throughout the design phase.
3.	Efficient Documentation: Automate dimensioning and annotation tasks, allowing architects to apply accurate measurements and labels with minimal manual effort, thereby accelerating project timelines. 
4.	Flexible Deployment: Offer dual functionality as a standalone tool for next-generation workflows and a premium plugin for integration into established BIM systems, catering to a broad spectrum of architectural practices.
By combining generative design intelligence with regulatory validation and documentation automation, ArchiCopilot seeks to empower architects to focus on high-value creative and analytical tasks, ultimately improving project efficiency and quality. This aligns with Mr. Liao’s overarching goal of deploying practical, technology-driven solutions that address real-world challenges in the architectural sector.
